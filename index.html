<h2 width=100%>My experience with editing</h2>
<p width=100%>5 Years ago My journey with editing videos started when I was watching Call of Duty montages. I found it very fascinating how people are able to sync music with videos so cleanly and make videos many times better. I ended up spending hours looking at tutorials of how to edit on Sony Vegas which was barley able to run on my laptop, infact my laptop was so slow that it took 5 hours to render a 2 minute video in 1080p. Heres a video below of a edit I did 5 years ago for my youtube channel (Warning its bad).</p>
